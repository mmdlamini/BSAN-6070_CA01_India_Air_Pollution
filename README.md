This repository houses my project done for BSAN-6070 (Intro to ML) course. 
India Air Pollution

# Dataset: Basic Info
##What is it about?
This data is released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy 
(NDSAP), using this one can explore India’s air pollution levels at a more granular scale.

## What information it has?
The dataset has 13 columns which are,

**stn_code:** Station Code\
**sampling_date:** Date of sampling (note how this is formatted)\
**state:** State\
**location:** Location of recording\
**agency:** Agency\
**type:** Type of area\
**so2:** Sulphur dioxide (µg/m3)\
**no2:** Nitrogen dioxide (µg/m3)\
**rspm:** Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (µg/m3)\
**spm:** Suspended Particulate Matter (µg/m3)\
**location_monitoring_station:** Location of data collection\
**pm2_5:** PSI 2.5 (µg/m3)\
**date:** Date of sampling

## Why we need these details?
SPM, RSPM, PM2.5 values are the parameters used to measure the quality of air based 
on the number of particles present in it. Using these values, we are going to identify the 
air quality over the period of time in different states of India.
